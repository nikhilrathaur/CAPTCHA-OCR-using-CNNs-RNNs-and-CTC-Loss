# CAPTCHA-OCR-using-CNNs-RNNs-and-CTC-Loss
Captchas had been used from quite some time to verify that the user or logger is a human being and not machine. But here I have implemented the Captcha reading model based on CNNs, RNNs and CTC loss.  
The best thing about this is that it is implemented on a ready to run google colab notebook. So there won't be any kind of dependency issue. But you can try testing the efficiency and quality of results by changing the parametres according to your computational ability.  
Don't forget to fork the repository in case you use this notebook.
